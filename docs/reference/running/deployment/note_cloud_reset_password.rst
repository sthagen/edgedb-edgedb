.. note:: Gel Cloud: Reset the default password for the admin role

    If you want to dump an existing Gel Cloud instance and restore it to a new self-managed instance, you need to change the automatically generated password for the default admin role - ``edgedb`` or ``admin``.
    The administrator role name and its password used in the dump/restore process must be the same in both the instance dumped from and the instance restored to for the Gel tooling to continue functioning properly.
    To change the default password in the Cloud instance, execute the following query in the instance:

    .. code-block:: edgeql-repl

        ALTER ROLE admin { set password := 'new_password' };
