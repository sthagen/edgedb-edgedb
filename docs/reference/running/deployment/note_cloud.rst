.. note:: Gel Cloud: The easiest way to run Gel

   **Gel Cloud** is the official hosted service managed by the Gel team, offering the simplest and most reliable way to run Gel in production. While self-hosting is possible (as shown in these guides), Gel Cloud provides a seamlessly integrated experience with perfect compatibility between local development and production environments. It includes a generous free tier, Vercel and GitHub (deploy previews work out of the box), a hosted UI, and using it directly supports the development of Gel itself!
