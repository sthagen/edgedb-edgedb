Installation
============

We provide a :ref:`CLI for managing and interacting with local and remote databases <ref_cli_overview>`. If you're using JavaScript or Python, our client libraries will handle downloading and running the CLI for you using tools like ``npx`` and ``uvx``.

For everyone else, or if you wish to install the CLI globally, you can install using our bash installer or your operating system's package manager.
